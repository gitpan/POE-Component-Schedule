    - Applied fix for RT#53925 (Patch by Zeph Gillen).

  author_name: Olivier Mengué
  changes:
    - Major internal rewrite. No external changes. I love TDD!
    - 'Now the scheduling session is detached from the session from which the session was spawned. This should help to avoid session attachment/references problems as the scheduler is not anymore attached to a particular session. Note that due to a POE bug, _child(lose) is still fired.'
    - Fixed typos in example code. kthakore++
    - 'TODO: add a test that extracts test code from the SYNOPSIS POD section and runs it. Maybe using Test::Pod::Snippets.'
