    Changes:
      - No functional change since 0.94_01.
      - 'Fixed constant functions: added "()" prototype to make them inlinable by perl. Should have been like that since 0.91_01. That should improve performance.'
      - 'Added .perlcriticrc to disable Perl::Critic policies that do not match our style (filled RT#57638, RT#57639, RT#57640, RT#57807 for issues with default policies).'
      - 'Made some suggestions from Perl::Critic. Reduced number of lines, so improved test coverage ratio.'

      - "Author build system: fixed the 'Build tag'."

      - "Author build system: Changes.{rss,yml} generation is now automated by extending Module::Build (see 'inc/MY/Build.pm' and 'inc/MY/Build/Changes.pm')."
      - Added 't/90-critic.t' to 'MANIFEST.SKIP' as it is the main cause of CPAN Testers failures.
      - "Author build system: Drop 'Makefile.PL' generation by Module::Build."

  - Author_Id: DOLMEN
    Author_Name: Olivier Mengué
    Changes:
      - 'RT#56447 fixed, but I expect to unapply the fix once RT#57314 (allow aliases in $poe_kernel->refcount_{in,de}crement) is implemented. Test cases added.'
      - Bug references are now linked in 'Changes.rss'.
      - 'Test coverage: 91.6%.'

    Changes:
      - Only minor POD changes in Schedule.pm since 0.93_02.
      - Increased dependencies versions.
      - Small tweak to the 'Changes' file format to make it more parseable and be able to generate 'Changes.yml' and 'Changes.rss'.
      - "Added 'Changes.rss' and 'Changes.yml', generated from 'Changes' using either 'make-Changes-rss.pl' or 'make-Changes-rss-2.pl' (see SVN repo)."
      - 'Test coverage: 92.1%.'

      - 'Improved argument check for ->add() (and now, with tests too).'
      - POE >= 1.281 is recommended as it fixes the _child(lose) issue.
      - 'Updated POD: removed obsolete warnings, updated copyright.'
      - 'Updated README: should be more helpful for distribution packagers.'

      - Applied fix for RT#53925 (Patch by Zeph Gillen).
      - Added t/50-subclass.t to try to catch subclassing problems which may affect POE::Component::Cron. Unfortunately it does not catch RT#53925. Help needed.
      - Added strictures in tests.
      - "Updated 'MANIFEST.SKIP' to match new Module::Build: ignore MYMETA.yml."

    Changes:
      - Major internal rewrite. No external changes. I love TDD!
      - 'Now the scheduling session is detached from the session from which the session was spawned. This should help to avoid session attachment/references problems as the scheduler is not anymore attached to a particular session. Note that due to a POE bug, _child(lose) is still fired.'
      - Fixed typos in example code. kthakore++
      - 'TODO: add a test that extracts test code from the SYNOPSIS POD section and runs it. Maybe using Test::Pod::Snippets.'
